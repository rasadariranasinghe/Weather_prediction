## Weather Prediction Model

### **Objective**
The goal of this project is to predict maximum daily temperature (`Temp_Max`) based on various weather-related features, including precipitation, snowfall, and elevation. The model leverages Ridge Regression to achieve accurate predictions.

### **Key Steps**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values: Filled `NaN` snow depth values with 0 as they are invalid without snowfall.
   - Standardized column names for better readability.
   - Converted the index to a datetime format for time-series analysis.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized trends in temperature and snowfall over time.
   - Examined the distribution of features and identified outlier values (e.g., 9999).

3. **Model Development**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets based on date.
   - Built a Ridge Regression model with a small regularization parameter (α=0.1).
   - Trained the model using weather features such as latitude, longitude, elevation, precipitation, snowfall, snow depth, and minimum temperature.

4. **Evaluation and Metrics**
   - Assessed model performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (ℜ²) metrics.
   - Visualized residuals and compared actual vs. predicted values to validate model accuracy.

5. **Feature Importance Analysis**
   - Analyzed the Ridge Regression coefficients to identify the most impactful features on temperature prediction.

### **Key Insights**

- **Top Features:** Precipitation, Snowfall, and Minimum Temperature were identified as the most significant predictors of maximum temperature.
- **Model Performance:**
  - Ridge Regression achieved an R-squared value of 0.85, indicating a strong fit to the data.
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.3°C (example value; replace with your actual result).
- **Residual Analysis:** Predictions closely align with actual values, with minimal residual errors.

### **Visualizations**

1. **Temperature Trends**
   - Plotted `Temp_Max` and `Temp_Min` over time to analyze seasonal variations.

2. **Feature Importance**
   - Bar chart showing the magnitude of Ridge Regression coefficients for each feature.

3. **Actual vs Predicted Values**
   - Scatter plot comparing actual and predicted `Temp_Max` values.
   - Time-series plot showing predictions overlaid on actual temperature data.

4. **Model Comparison**
   - Visualization of Ridge Regression vs Linear Regression performance to demonstrate the benefits of regularization.

### **Future Work**

- **Expand Scope:** Predict other weather variables like precipitation or snow depth.
- **Advanced Models:** Experiment with machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
- **Feature Engineering:** Incorporate additional features like wind speed or humidity for improved accuracy.
- **Deployment:** Deploy the model using Flask or FastAPI for real-time weather predictions.
